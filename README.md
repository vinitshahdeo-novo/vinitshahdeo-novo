### Hi there 👋

I am a Software Engineer who is deeply passionate about **JavaScript** and contributing to **open-source** projects. I find a perfect balance between writing code and enjoying a game of **badminton**🏸. There's something truly serene about taking sips of tea 🍵 while diving into poetry. My enthusiasm for technology extends to being an avid lover of **API**s, where I'm always excited to explore and work with them.
